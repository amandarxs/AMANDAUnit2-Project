        <h1 class="what">What is the LGBTQ+?</h1>
        <p class="desc">The LGBTQ+ is a group of people who do not identify as heterosexual or cisgender.The letters in "LGBTQ+" are used to describe those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and/or those who are still questioning their identities. Many members of the community are sadly discriminated against for no good reason, and we would love to help prevent that. Below will be some links leading to ways of support, information, and much more. Your support will help those in need, those who feel left out, and those who are discriminated against for who they are. We are equal as humans and we should all be treated so.</p>
